I used the apartment complex's gym. At this point I did not know anything about nutrition nor was I consuming any supplements."

      "My college roommate had dated a nutritionist and was actively doing Insanity. He taught me to eat for function and not for pleasure. He opened my eyes to all the trash ingredients on the food at the grocery store and the importance of protein. He also shared his personal choice of not eating after 8 pm. I took a weight lifting class and learned the Olympic lifts, adopted a T-TH full body work out and did Insanity on M-W-F. I started consuming protein shakes and drinking a gallon of water a day. Abs finally showed up at 185 lbs!"

      "I learned the real purpose of Intermittent Fasting is to get to a calorie deficit. I learned about TEF, TDEE, calorie cycling, the energy balance equation, and protein intake. I estimated the calories in the foods I consumed and made slight adjustments to my diet. I got tired of driving to a crowded gym so I ditched the weights and stuck to Insanity. I got down to 170 lbs and I felt in the best shape of my life. I started an ongoing goal to always be fit on my birthday."

      "I do Insanity outside but I didn't want to because it was so cold. I live on the third floor so I can't do it inside without bothering my neighbors. I didn't know how to keep active so I began developing my workout builder. My apartment then flooded. My cats and I moved in with my sister for a month and a half after we spent 5 days without power and water. I got carried away with the emotional aftermath of my apartment being ruined and the world ending (lol). I let go and I ended putting on 30 lbs in 2 months. Back to being 200 lbs."

I made sure to maintain a calorie deficit, eat single ingredient foods, eat enough protein, drink a gallon of water a day, and exercise. I came across Team Body Project and adopted their awesome short routines as a second daily workout."

I aim to be more resilient next time life happens. It is harder to eat right daily than to workout daily. Working smarter not harder means controlling our calories."
